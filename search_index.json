Vulnerabilities & Suggested Fixes","keywords":"","body":"Common Vulnerabilities & Suggested Fixes\n\nCross Site Scripting - Client side vulnerability, occurs when user input is rendered without any output encoding or input sanitization \nImpact - Cookie Theft, Execute Malicious Javascript, Phishing, Open Redirect, Submit internal forms bypassing CORS/CSRF, If Electron app even RCE possible.\nFix - Input Sanitization & Output Encoding,  Use Security Frameworks & Libraries, CSP, X-XSS-Protection header(no longer useful, uses browser's xss auditor which most browsers stopped)\nVariants - Reflected, Stored, DOM Based, HTML Injection, CSS Injection.\n\n\nCross Site Request Forgery - Victim is tricked into submitting a malicious cross site request from attacker's website, which causes unintended action's on a cross site website where victim is already logged in.\nImpact - Attacker can perform unauthorized & undesired actions on a cross site website on behalf of the victim.\nFix - Use unique & long CSRF tokens for each forms/requests where important user action is performed, Use SameSite Cookies in Strict mode(Lax can bypass Top Level GET Requests like redirecting to cross site page), Referer based validation (Not recommended, some browsers do not send referer headers, few website have referer policy to not send referer header).\n\n\nSQL Injection - When website accepts user input & uses the user input to construct & run sql queries without sanitizing the user input, attacker can use malicious payloads as user input to run arbitrary SQL queries.\nImpact - Attacker can dump. modify or delete database.\nFix - Parameterized SQL Statements, Input Validation.\nVariants - General, Blind\n\n\nBroken Authentication - When server fails to validate if user is the person they

If resource server fails to properly validate from authorization server whether the access_token really belongs to the user identifier(email/userid) in the API request, attacker can use own access_token replacing user identifier(email/userid) to obtain victim's session. [PortSwigger Lab]\nFlawed CSRF Protection -  This is already explained in detail earlier, This occurs because of missing or improper state param validation at client end, in case PKCE isn't used. [PortSwigger Lab]\nOpen Redirect - If authorization_server doesn't properly validate redirect_uri callback parameter, attacker modify the parameter value to his own website, after the victim successfully authenticates, authorization code or access token is sent to attacker's website instead of client leading to account takeover in most cases. [PortSwigger Lab]\nDisclosure of client_secret in case of Confidential Client - If Confidential client is planned to use, but client_secret is disclosed by Client by either hardcoding somewhere or through network interception.\nImproper Validation of Scope by Resource Server - If attacker is able to modify scope param to elevate privilege & victim authenticates, Resource server/Attacker finally gets access token with elevated privilege, Resource server should properly validate & assign scope to user session without blindly trusting the access token recieved from authorization server. [PortSwigger Reference] \nUnverified user registration - Some OAuth authorization server provides option to regsiter themselves with username/email & password without proper email verification.This might lead to account takeover if attacker uses email id of victim to register in OAuth authorization server & use that to sign into Client where victim is already registered using Client's own authentication mechanism(email/password).\nNo Access Token Expiry - Access token should be configured to expire in short span of time(60 mins), If necessary refresh token can be used to regenerate access token.\nAccess Token Valid after User Logout - Access tokens should be revoked immediately if user choses to log out, at time's client doesn't revoke the access token even after logout.\n\n"},"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/saml.html":{"url":"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/saml.html","title":"SAML","keywords":"","body":"SAML\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) enables SSO(Single Sign On) for Service Provider(SP) by using Identity Provider(Identity Provider) to authenticate to multiple services using single credential.\nThis is a legacy protocol which utilizes XML in SAML requests & responses, improper utilization of XML itself will lead to lot of vulnerabilities like XXE, Hence usage of SAML is highly not recommended unless necessary.

XML Signature that protects the integrity of SAML assertions & messages, the SAML assertion or may not be signed. The example above contains two ds:Signature elements. First ds:Signature element is signamture for whole SAML Response message, while later is that of SAML assertion.\nsaml:Assertion - These have information regarding user principal, user attributes, roles, session expiry & other user related information.\nsaml:Subject - It's contains the principal subject of SAML Assertion, the user or unique identifier which is used for authentication.The value of NameID is generally used as unique identifier for authentication.\nsaml:StatusCode - Denotes whether authentication is successfull in IdP or not.\nsaml:Conditions -  Specifies things like the time an Assertion is valid and that the Assertion is addressed to a particular Service Provider.\nsaml:AuthnStatement - Denotes that IdP authenticated the Subject of the Assertion.\nsaml:AttributeStatement - Has Attributes that describe the Subject of the Assertion.\nXML Signature\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n     \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nXML Signature can be used to sign entire SAML Response message or particular XML tree like assertion.\nReference element's URI attribute denotes element whose signature is calculated. This URI attribute must match ID attribute of element to be signed. For ex, URI=\"#_e0acf8ced7e2cafc7c65b2c097842486e0838d76e0\" in the SAML Response denotes it's signature for Assertion element with ID=\"_e0acf8ced7e2cafc7c65b2c097842486e0838d76e0\".\nCanonicalizationMethod specifies whether the whitespaces or comments should be normalized or not.\nTransforms specifies how the XML document must be transformed & how the signature must be calculated. Three common transforms are Enveloped Signature, Enveloping Signature & Detached Signature.\nEnveloped Signature - In this type, Signature element is wrapped inside the element for which signature is being calculated.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nEnveloping Signature - In this type, Element for which signature needs to be calculated is wrapped inside the Signature element.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nDetached Signature - In this type, neither the signature element wraps the element it signs, nor the element which needs to be signed wraps the signature, i.e signature element is detached from the element which needs to be signed.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nDigestMethod - This specifies the hashing algorithm which needs to be used to calculate digest value of element which needs to be signed.\nSignatureMethod - Defines the signature algorithm which needs to be used to calculate Signature of reference element.\nKeyInfo - This contains public key/certificate which needs to be used to check if signature is valid, It's the public key of IdP, It's suggested to store public key of IdP locally in SP & validate signature instead of relying on KeyInfo.\nXSW Attacks - \nIn XML Signature Wrapping(XSW) attack, attacker modifies the XML document such that signature of the reference element/document is still valid, but due to application logic error in retrieving the referenced element, application actually retrieves the maliciously induced reference element rather than the original one.\nXSW 1 Example - \n\n\nIn the above example, the attacker tries to wrap original Response element inside another evil Response element, Keeping the signature references of the original Response element intact, so that signature doesn't change. Attacker also adds his own Assertion element inside his own evil Response element.\nWhen application tries to check for signature it will appear to be valid, but when it retrieves assertion element it retrieves evil Response element's Assertion instead of the original Assertion element.\nThere are 8 such XSW types, these are better explained at here.\nYou can use SAML Raider Burp Plugin to find all such XSW vulnerabilities easily.\nVulnerability Checklist\n\nCheck for XXE & XSLT related vulnerabilities\nCheck for DoS scenario by giving large amount of data in SAML Response for SP\nCheck for XSW attacks, SAML Raider can be used to check for these attacks.\nCheck for Signature Exclusion attack, by removing the signature. SAML Raider can be used to check for this attack.\nCheck for Invalid Signature attack, by modifying content of reference element. May be application is checking for presence of Signature element instead of validating it properly.\nCheck for Certificate Faking attack, If there is certificates present in SAML Response(KeyInfo) which is used for signature verification instead of locally stored IdP certificate, try to generate self signed certificate in KeyInfo & modify the contents of reference element & Sign the reference element using our own self signed certificate. You can use SAML Raider to perform this attack.\nCheck for Token Recipient Confusion attack, Generate valid SAML Response for one SP, use the same SAML Response for some other SP.\nCheck for comment injection attack 1, for example if user able to register in IdP admin\\@idp.com, This will be parsed by SP as admin@idp.com depending upon canonicalization & logged in as admin@idp.com instead of admin\\@idp.com.\nCheck for replay attack after long time, to test is SP is properly validating saml:SubjectConfirmationData element's NotOnOrAfter attribute.\nCheck if SP is regularly validating if currently logged in user is present in IdP or not. After login to SP, delete account in IdP, even after long time if you are logged in to SP, it's a session management issue.[Mozilla's Blog]\n\n"},"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/jwt.html":{"url":"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/jwt.html","title":"JWT","keywords":"","body":"JWT\nJSON Web Tokens(JWT) contain claims used for authentication & authorization like session related attributes, role of user, session expiry etc, these are verifiable by server cryptographically by validating the signature part of JWT.\nJWT Format - \n\nHeader - Header contain information about algorithm used for generating JWT Signature, It may also contain keys, key location, key id's used for generating Signature in some cases.\nPayload - Payload contains actual information like user identity(email/username), \nSignature - Header & Payload, encrypted by server to cryptographically verify that JWT Token isn't modified client side by the attacker.\n\neyJraWQiOiI5MTM2ZGRiMy1jYjBhLTRhMTktYTA3ZS1lYWRmNWE0NGM4YjUiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.\neyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsImV4cCI6MTY0ODAzNzE2NCwibmFtZSI6IkNhcmxvcyBNb250b3lhIiwic3ViIjoiY2FybG9zIiwicm9sZSI6ImJsb2dfYXV0aG9yIiwiZW1haWwiOiJjYXJsb3NAY2FybG9zLW1vbnRveWEubmV0IiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.\nSYZBPIBg2CRjXAJ8vCER0LA_ENjII1JakvNQoP-Hw6GG1zfl4JyngsZReIfqRvIAEi5L4HV0q7_9qGhQZvy9ZdxEJbwTxRs_6Lb-fZTDpW6lKYNdMyjw45_alSCZ1fypsMWz_2mTpQzil0lOtps5Ei_z7mM7M8gCwe_AGpI53JxduQOaB5HkT5gVrv9cKu9CsW5MS6ZbqYXpGyOG5ehoxqm8DL5tFYaW3lB50ELxi0KsuTKEbD0t5BCl0aCR2MBJWAbN-xeLwEenaqBiwPVvKixYleeDQiBEIylFdNNIMviKRgXiYuAvMziVPbwSgkZVHeEdF5MQP1Oe2Spac-6IfA\nJWT is of form Header.Payload.Signature, where each part is seperated by full stop(.) & each part is encoded in base64 format.\nFor example on decoding above payload, we get -\n{\"iss\":\"portswigger\",\"exp\":1648037164,\"name\":\"Carlos Montoya\",\"sub\":\"carlos\",\"role\":\"blog_author\",\"email\":\"carlos@carlos-montoya.net\",\"iat\":1516239022}\nJWT Signature\nJWT Signature is generated by hashing & encrypting the header & payload of JWT token with server's secret signing key.

But there may be a necessity to allow cross origin response reading or DOM manipulation for specific origin.\\\nFor ex: example.com might need to access data from api.example.com which might be legit.\nCORS was introduced to add flexibility to SOP restriction & define access control for resources interacting with cross origin domains.\nWhat is a Simple HTTP Request ?\nA request is Simple HTTP Request only if it matches the below conditions - \n\nMethod: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS\nContent-Type: The Content-Type request header may contain only application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data or text/plain\nNo custom headers are included in request other than standard one's like Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type, Range (only with a simple range header value; e.g., bytes=256- or bytes=127-255).\n\nWhat is a PREFLIGHT Request ?\nAny request other than Simple HTTP Request trigger a PREFLIGHT(OPTIONS) request by browser. The initial PREFLIGHT request doesn't include cookies of cross origin. The value of Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Access-Control-Expose-Headers in response to PREFLIGHT determine whether real request can be made or not, whether real request may include credentials or not & whether cross origin access is permitted for client requesting the real request.\nCORS feature depends on response headers provided by server as discussed below.\nFew important CORS Response Headers - \n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:  This header determines whether client can access cross origin resource or not. Absence of this header means by default cross origin resources cannot be accessed by javascript. It may can contain *, \\ or null. \\ can only be single origin as no browser support multiple origin.  \nAsterisk(*): Any Origin can access the resource, Note that Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true is not allowed if * is present in Access-Control-Allow-Origin.\n\\: Only client request originating from specific origin is allowed. For example: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com means, only http://example.com can access http://api.example.com resources(If client request is made for api.example.com).\nnull: When local HTML file are used to make cross origin requests, Origin is set to null, This option is used to facilitate local development for testing purpose, But this can option be abused which will be discussed later.\n\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: This header tells browser whether or not browser can include credentials in cross origin requests. It may have true or false, true signifies browser may send cookies when making cross origin requests, false signifies browser cannot send cookies for cross origin requests.\nFor Simple Requests which do not trigger Preflight(OPTIONS) request, browser will include cookies for cross origin sites by default, If Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false or absent then the browser doesn't allow reading of cross origin response or DOM using javascript.\nFor Requests which trigger Preflight, credentials are not included by default for the preflight request.
