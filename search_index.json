Vulnerabilities & Suggested Fixes","keywords":"","body":"Common Vulnerabilities & Suggested Fixes\n\nCross Site Scripting - Client side vulnerability, occurs when user input is rendered without any output encoding or input sanitization \nImpact - Cookie Theft, Execute Malicious Javascript, Phishing, Open Redirect, Submit internal forms bypassing CORS/CSRF, If Electron app even RCE possible.\nFix - Input Sanitization & Output Encoding,  Use Security Frameworks & Libraries, CSP, X-XSS-Protection header(no longer useful, uses browser's xss auditor which most browsers stopped)\nVariants - Reflected, Stored, DOM Based, HTML Injection, CSS Injection.\n\n\nCross Site Request Forgery - Victim is tricked into submitting a malicious cross site request from attacker's website, which causes unintended action's on a cross site website where victim is already logged in.\nImpact - Attacker can perform unauthorized & undesired actions on a cross site website on behalf of the victim.\nFix - Use unique & long CSRF tokens for each forms/requests where important user action is performed, Use SameSite Cookies in Strict mode(Lax can bypass Top Level GET Requests like redirecting to cross site page), Referer based validation (Not recommended, some browsers do not send referer headers, few website have referer policy to not send referer header).\n\n\nSQL Injection - When website accepts user input & uses the user input to construct & run sql queries without sanitizing the user input, attacker can use malicious payloads as user input to run arbitrary SQL queries.\nImpact - Attacker can dump. modify or delete database.\nFix - Parameterized SQL Statements, Input Validation.\nVariants - General, Blind\n\n\nBroken Authentication - When server fails to validate if user is the person they say they are, i.e person is authenticated or not.\nImpact - Attacker able to perform actions on server without any authentication or impersonating as someone else due to flaws in authentication logic.\nFix - Authenticate all important & sensitive post login urls, Use random, secure & long session id's, rate limit & use captcha for login endpoints, implement 2FA.

If resource server fails to properly validate from authorization server whether the access_token really belongs to the user identifier(email/userid) in the API request, attacker can use own access_token replacing user identifier(email/userid) to obtain victim's session. [PortSwigger Lab]\nFlawed CSRF Protection -  This is already explained in detail earlier, This occurs because of missing or improper state param validation at client end, in case PKCE isn't used. [PortSwigger Lab]\nOpen Redirect - If authorization_server doesn't properly validate redirect_uri callback parameter, attacker modify the parameter value to his own website, after the victim successfully authenticates, authorization code or access token is sent to attacker's website instead of client leading to account takeover in most cases. [PortSwigger Lab]\nDisclosure of client_secret in case of Confidential Client - If Confidential client is planned to use, but client_secret is disclosed by Client by either hardcoding somewhere or through network interception.\nImproper Validation of Scope by Resource Server - If attacker is able to modify scope param to elevate privilege & victim authenticates, Resource server/Attacker finally gets access token with elevated privilege, Resource server should properly validate & assign scope to user session without blindly trusting the access token recieved from authorization server. [PortSwigger Reference] \nUnverified user registration - Some OAuth authorization server provides option to regsiter themselves with username/email & password without proper email verification.This might lead to account takeover if attacker uses email id of victim to register in OAuth authorization server & use that to sign into Client where victim is already registered using Client's own authentication mechanism(email/password).\nNo Access Token Expiry - Access token should be configured to expire in short span of time(60 mins), If necessary refresh token can be used to regenerate access token.\nAccess Token Valid after User Logout - Access tokens should be revoked immediately if user choses to log out, at time's client doesn't revoke the access token even after logout.\n\n"},"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/saml.html":{"url":"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/saml.html","title":"SAML","keywords":"","body":"SAML\n"},"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/jwt.html":{"url":"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/jwt.html","title":"JWT","keywords":"","body":"JWT\n"},"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/two-factor-authentication-checklist.html":{"url":"web/authentication-mechanism-and-vulnerabilities/two-factor-authentication-checklist.html","title":"Two Factor Authentication Checklist","keywords":"","body":"Two Factor Authentication Checklist\n\nCheck whether 2FA code can be bruteforced.\nCheck whether 2FA code is unique for each user & other user code cannot be used.\nCheck whether 2FA code be reused & doesn't have a specific expiry time.\nResponse manipulation by modifying success status in place of failure, even though wrong 2FA is entered.\nCheck where the secret QR code used for TOTP is stored, is it accessible publicly ?
