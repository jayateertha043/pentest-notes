# Same Origin Policy (SOP)

Same Origin Policy is a browser protection mechanism which prevents website of cross origins from reading other origin's resources through javascript.

**Cross Origin Reads** using fetch(), XMLHttpRequest & related API's are restricted by SOP. I.E, Javascript running on one origin cannot read network response or DOM of another origin.

**Note**:&#x20;

1. The request to another cross origin will be made(even including cookies - again, depending on how the samesite cookie's are set in cross origin website), only response cannot be read due to SOP. Hence, **SOP doesn't prevent from CSRF attacks**.
2. Some of legacy javascript api's can access cross origin objects for backward compatibility, You can read about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin\_policy#cross-origin\_script\_api\_access). These javascript's are typically exploited in [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/) attacks.

**SOP may allow** -&#x20;

1. **Cross Origin Writes** - Forms, redirects etc
2. **Cross Origin Embeds** - IFrame,  Embed, Video, Image, Object, Script, Link(Stylesheets) etc
