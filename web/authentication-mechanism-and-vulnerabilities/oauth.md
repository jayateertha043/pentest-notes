7. code - authorization code is sent in callback url for Authorization Code Grant flow which is later exchanged for access & refresh tokens.
8. code\_challenge - Code challenge is used in PKCE grant type & is like a state param, but this is associated with particular authorization code, stored & validated by authorization server instead of client end.
9. code\_verifier - code\_verifier is used in PKCE request during exchange of authorization code for access & refresh tokens, The code verifier should match code\_challenge sent during initial step.
10. code\_challenge\_method - Code challenge can be either plain or S256 (SHA256 of code challenge & base64 encode the hash).
11. [grant\_type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) -&#x20;

    1. authorization\_code - Authorization Code Grant Flow
    2. token -  Implicit Grant Flow
    3. PKCE - similar to authorization grant flow, but also include code\_challenge & code\_verifier which acts like state param, but code\_challenge is associated with particular authorization\_code, stored & validated at authorization server end, instead of client end incase of state param.
    4. password - username & password provided by client is sent to authorization server in exchange for access & refresh token.
